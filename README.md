## Caesar Cipher

The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It works by shifting each letter in the plaintext message by a fixed number of positions down or up the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3, 'A' would become 'D', 'B' would become 'E', and so on.

Despite its simplicity, the Caesar Cipher was used by Julius Caesar to communicate secretly with his generals during military campaigns. It is a foundational concept in cryptography and serves as the basis for more complex encryption algorithms.

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
cd Caesar-Cipher-

3. **Run the Python script:**
python caesar_cipher.py

4. **Follow the on-screen instructions:**
Type encrypt to encrypt a message or decrypt to decrypt a message.
Enter your message.
Specify the shift key/number.
Repeat the process to encrypt/decrypt additional messages.
Type no when prompted to quit the program.

5. **Example:**

ðŸŽ­ Welcome to Caesar Cipher ðŸŽ­

	Type 'encrypt' for encryption, 'decrypt' for decryption:  
	encrypt
	Type your message: 
	hello world
	Type the shift number: 
	3
	ðŸ”’ Encrypting message...
	ðŸŽ‰ Encryption successful!

	ðŸ”’ Encrypted message: khoor zruog

Type 'yes' to play again, else 'no' to quit: 
	yes
	Type 'encrypt' for encryption, 'decrypt' for decryption:  
	decrypt
	Type your message: 
	khoor zruog
	Type the shift number: 
	3
	ðŸ”“ Decrypting message...
	ðŸŽ‰ Decryption successful!

	ðŸ”“ Decrypted message: hello world

Type 'yes' to play again, else 'no' to quit: 
	no
ðŸ‘‹ Bye!
